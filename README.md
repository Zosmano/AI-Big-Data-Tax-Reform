# 🤖 AI & Big Data for African Tax Reform

## 💡 Project Goal

This research project focuses on designing a scalable, data-driven framework to enhance tax revenue collection by addressing the challenges posed by Africa's large informal sector.

## 📊 Key Deliverables & Technologies

This project required the integration of various data sources and technical tools to create actionable intelligence:

| **Category** | **Tools Used** | **Deliverable** |

|**Data Acquisition & Modeling**| **Python** (Pandas, text processing)| Created **predictive models** to estimate potential revenue in informal sectors|
|**Database Management** | **SQL** | Structured and managed the diverse datasets (geospatial, mobile transaction, and informal sector economic data)|
| **Visualization & Reporting** | **Power BI** | Developed **interactive dashboards** to visualize tax potential maps and policy impact scenarios for decision-makers. |**Preparing findings** for presentation at the Global Conference Alliance Inc., Canada (2026). |

## ⚙️ Methodology Summary

The methodology involved a three-part process:

1.  **Data Sourcing & ETL:** Sourced and cleaned unstructured geospatial, economic, and mobile transaction data. Used Python for text processing and ETL workflow automation to ensure data consistency.
2.  **Model Development:** Employed statistical and machine learning techniques to correlate demographic, location, and transactional data points to create a "Tax Potential Index."
3.  **Visualization & Action:** The final Power BI visualization layer allows governments to prioritize regions for improved tax outreach and infrastructure investment.

## 🔗 Status

* **Status:** Currently refining models and preparing final research documentation.
* **Next Steps:** Finalize the whitepaper and presentation materials for the 2026 conference.
